# Simple To‑Do List Web App

## Overview
A lightweight, single-file to-do list web app that lets you add tasks, mark them as done, and remove them. It stores your tasks in the browser using localStorage, so your list persists between sessions. No frameworks or build tools required.

Key features:
- Add tasks via button or Enter key
- Mark tasks as done with a checkbox
- Remove individual tasks
- Filter by All, Active, or Done
- Clear all completed tasks
- Keyboard and accessible labels
- Local storage persistence

## Setup
- No installation needed.
- Download or copy the `index.html` file.
- Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

Optional:
- Serve locally for best experience (e.g., `npx serve` or any static server), though not required.

## Usage
- Add a task:
  - Type a description into the input field.
  - Press Enter or click the “Add Task” button.
- Mark as done:
  - Click the checkbox next to a task to toggle its completion state.
- Remove a task:
  - Click the “Delete” button on the task you want to remove.
- Filter:
  - Use the All, Active, Done buttons in the footer to view specific subsets.
- Clear completed:
  - Click “Clear Completed” to remove all tasks that are marked as done.

Notes:
- Tasks are saved automatically in your browser’s localStorage.
- If you open the file for the first time with no tasks, a few helpful sample tasks are added.
